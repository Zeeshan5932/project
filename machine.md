**Definition:**

Machine Learning is the branch  of AI Which Focus on method  that can learn from examples and experiences instead of Relying on hard-coded rule and make predictions on new data

**Types of Machine Learning**

There are primarily three types of machine learning: Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning.

- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning

**01- Supervised Machine Learning**

Supervised machine Learning is a type of machine Learning that used Label data to trai the models.. In labeled data, the output is already known called Supervised Machine learning

**Example**

If you go to a grocery shop, everything is labeled there. For example, if you want ice cream, it's labeled there. This is how supervised learning works—it works with labeled data.

**Algorithm**

Some of the most popularly used supervised learning algorithms are:

- Linear Regression 
- Logistic Regression 
- Support Vector Machine
- K Nearest Neighbor 
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Naive Bayes

**Applications:**

- Supervised learning algorithms are generally used for solving classification and regression problems. 
- Few of the top supervised learning applications are weather prediction, sales forecasting, stock price analysis.


**02- Unsupervised Learning**

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that uses unlabeled data to train machines. Unlabeled data doesn’t have a fixed output variable. The model learns from the data, discovers the patterns and features in the data, and returns the output

**Example**

 Let's say you have a collection of news articles, but they're not labeled with categories like sports, politics, or entertainment. With unsupervised learning, algorithms can automatically analyze the content of these articles and group them based on similarities in topics, keywords, or themes

**Algorithms:**

Selecting the right algorithm depends on the type of problem you are trying to solve. Some of the common examples of unsupervised learning are:

- K Means Clusterin
- Hierarchical Clustering 
- DBSCAN 
- Principal Component Analysis

**Applications**

One of the applications of unsupervised learning is customer segmentation. Based on customer behavior, likes, dislikes, and interests, you can segment and cluster similar customers into a group

**03- Reinforcement Learning**

Reinforcement Learning trains a machine to take suitable actions and maximize its rewards in a particular situation. It uses an agent and an environment to produce actions and rewards. The agent has a start and an end state. But, there might be different paths for reaching the end state, like a maze. In this learning technique, there is no predefined target variable

**Example :**

Imagine you're learning to ride a bicycle, and when you first try, you wobble and fall down a bit. But then you realize that if you pedal harder, you can perform much better. So, you keep trying like this, and eventually, you'll learn how to ride the bicycle.


**Algorithms**

Some of the important reinforcement learning algorithms are:

- Q-learning 
- Sarsa 
- Monte Carlo 
- Deep Q network
